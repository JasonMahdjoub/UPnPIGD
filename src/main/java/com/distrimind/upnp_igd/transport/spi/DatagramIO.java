 * Service for receiving (unicast only) and sending UDP datagrams, one per bound IP address.
 * <p>
 * This service typically listens on a socket for UDP unicast datagrams, with
 * an ephemeral port.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This listening loop is started with the <code>run()</code> method,
 * this service is <code>Runnable</code>. Any received datagram is then converted into an
 * {@link IncomingDatagramMessage} and
 * handled by the
 * {@link Router#received(IncomingDatagramMessage)}
 * method. This conversion is the job of the {@link DatagramProcessor}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients of this service use it to send UDP datagrams, either to a unicast
 * or multicast destination. Any {@link OutgoingDatagramMessage} can
 * be converted and written into a datagram with the {@link DatagramProcessor}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An implementation has to be thread-safe.
 * </p>

 * @param <C> The type of the service's configuration.
