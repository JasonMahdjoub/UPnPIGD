/**
 * Interface of the network transport layer.
 * <p>
 * Encapsulates the transport layer and provides methods to the upper layers for
 * sending UPnP stream (HTTP) {@link StreamRequestMessage}s,
 * sending (UDP) datagram {@link OutgoingDatagramMessage}s,
 * as well as broadcasting bytes to all LAN participants.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A router also maintains listening sockets and services, for incoming UDP unicast/multicast
 * {@link IncomingDatagramMessage} and TCP
 * {@link UpnpStream}s. An implementation of this interface
 * handles these messages, e.g. by selecting and executing the right protocol.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An implementation must be thread-safe, and can be accessed concurrently. If the Router is
 * disabled, it doesn't listen on the network for incoming messages and does not send outgoing
 * messages.
